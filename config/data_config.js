      'Ceramics courses at Langara offer students foundational techniques in clay that allow for the development of a range of forms, from functional objects to multimedia sculptures. Students explore a variety of hand building techniques, mold making and wheel throwing to create functional, decorative, and sculptural forms. They learn to fire work in a variety of kilns, temperatures, and atmospheres (raku, gas and electric). They make slips and glazes and experiment with a myriad of surface embellishments including printing on clay. Conceptual development and personal research is supported by presentations, reading groups and discussions that help each student develop their practice. Upon completion of the Langara Ceramics Program students are able to situate their practice within the arc of historical and contemporary ceramics making.',

In first year, perceptual skills are emphasized with subject matter that includes still-life, life models, and the urban/natural environment. For second year, studio work is complemented with critiques, lectures, and research into artists who use drawing as a primary medium. Students engage with a wide range of traditional and non-traditional drawing materials often working from challenging studio set-ups, regularly involving a life model. Traditional drawing practices are emphasized while addressing the role of drawing in the 21st century. Independent research is encouraged, and the relationship of drawing to the wider contemporary context is explored.',

Researching and responding to the history of performance from early avant-garde cabaret to contemporary art, students explore the politics of the body, liveness, mediation and the role of documentation in their work. Performance courses aim to offer students a balance between playfulness and criticality amid an environment of creative risk taking and experimentation.',
